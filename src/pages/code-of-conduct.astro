      <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

      <p>
        ForwardJS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for
        everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity, gender expression,
        sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
        ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or religion (or lack thereof).
        ForwardJS does not tolerate harassment of event participants or staff at
        any time nor in any form.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyone violating these guidelines may be removed from the event and/or
        our platforms at our sole discretion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank you for helping make ForwardJS a welcoming, friendly event for
        all.
      </p>

      <h2>Expected Behavior</h2>

      <p>

        platforms (Discord, Meetup, etc) should be appropriate for a
        professional audience including people of many different backgrounds.
        Please be kind to others.
      </p>

      <p>

        <li>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing comments.</li>
        <li>
          Be mindful of your fellow attendees and alert an Organizer if you
          notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or someone
          violating this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Unacceptable Behavior</h2>

      <p>
        Unacceptable behaviors include intimidating, harassing, abusive,
        discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech and comments, at all
        related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the
        context of ForwardJS.
      </p>

      <p>
        Harassment includes, but is not limited to, harmful or prejudicial

        expression, sexual orientation, race, religion (or lack thereof),

        presentation slides), deliberate intimidation, stalking or following,
        harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or

        or other participant, including sponsors, speakers, and those with
        decision-making authority.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply
        immediately.
      </p>

      <p>
        If an attendee or other participant engages in unacceptable behavior,
        the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up
        to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from ForwardJS
        without warning (and without refund if applicable).
